Graphics::Plotter v1.0.1 - a perl5 interface to Robert S. Maier' plotter plotutils' library

This is Plotter.pm, a Perl5 binding for GNU plotutils
libplotter C++ library. With this module you can create
two-dimensional graphics for different kinds of plotters.
Plotter outputs include 'Meta', 'Tek', 'HPGL', 'PCL',
'Fig', 'PS', 'AI', 'PNM', 'GIF', 'XDrawable' and 'X'.

COPYRIGHT INFO

INSTALLATION

To install this module, cd to the directory that contains this README
file and type the following:

   perl Makefile.PL
   make
   make test
   make install

If you have not /usr/X11/include/X11/Xlib.h nor /usr/local/include/X11/Xlib.h
nor /usr/X11R6/include/X11/Xlib.h, then you could not compile
support for Graphics::Plotter::X, your X display is missing. Under RedHat
Linux you need to install XFree86-devel package (before the plotutils
compilation, I have not seen plotutils rpm package).

Plotter.pm package appears to run successfuly either on RedHat Linux
and on SUN Solaris2.6 with GNU g++ compiler.

REQUIREMENTS

You have to have plotutils v2.2 or later installed. To compile
a module you need C++ compiler.

EXAMPLES

See examples/ subdirectory.

DOCUMENTATION

To learn how to use this module, you can read manual created from the
Plotter.pm pod documentation (just "man Graphics::Plotter" after installation).
You can learn more from the plotutils documentation (pod manual
is mainly based on this) at http://www.gnu.org/manual/plotutils/
or info documentation in the plotutils distribution.

BUGS

If you want dynamically load a module on Solaris2.6 and you have
set locale to iso8859-2, and you have Euro currency patch installed,
then you would get the following error:

ld.so.1: /usr/bin/perl: fatal: relocation error: file
/usr/openwin/lib/locale/iso8859-2/xomEuro.so.2: symbol
_XlcCompileResourceList: referenced symbol not found

To avoid this message, just set locale to "C" (setenv LC_ALL C, or export LC_ALL=C).

The parampl functions used to set XDRAWABLE_COLORMAP XDRAWABLE_DISPLAY
XDRAWABLE_DRAWABLE1 and XDRAWABLE_DRAWABLE2 should not work because
this params need specific arguments (Display * pointer etc.)
